#Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
#
#Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:
#
#Number of vowels: 5

# Paste your code into this box count = 0

count = 0

for char in s:
    if char == 'a' or char == 'e' or char == 'i' or char == 'o' or char == 'u':
        count += 1
print("Number of vowels: " + str(count))
